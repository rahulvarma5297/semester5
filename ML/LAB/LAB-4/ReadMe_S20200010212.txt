ML Lab-4:

Submitted one file (I implemented Discretize, without Discretize, and OCR data in same file):
	
	Discretize: Rounding the value done by two functions
		1) discretize_str_float, 2) discretize_str_int (21-35 line in code file).
	
	With out Discretize : simply using the given data.
	OCR data given in last assignment.
		


0)  Use the Iris data which was divided in to training (with 120 training examples) and test data (with 30 test examples) as created in previous assignments.

	In line 179 => division_parts = 5
	this divides the data into 5 parts and take 1 part as test data and other as training data
	so, 150 divided into 30,30,30,30,30 one part of 30 taken as test data, other 120 taken as training data.
	30 , 120 divided.

1) Discretize the data by rounding each feature value to its closest integer (1 Marks)

	Simply convert the data into round value, after reading the data we can convert.
	reading the data at the line (165) in code
	and converting using the functions discretize_str_float and discretize_str_int.
	
	Implementing of these funcitons are at (36 - 50 line) in code.

	Accuracy with Discretization of data: 92.66666667%

2) Employ Naive Bayes Classifier and thus give your observation and results (3 Marks).

	
	The fundamental Naive Bayes assumption is that each feature makes an:
		--> independent and equal
	classes are independent.
	and coded the logic explained in the class.

3) If the data is used without discretization, then what is the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier. Give your observation, result (2 Marks)

	Without Discretization:
		use the data as it is (do not round off)
	(180- 192 line) in code.

	Accuracy without Discretization : 95.33333333%.

	Observation:
  		when we are discretizing the data, Accuracy is decreasing.
		With out discretizing Accuracy is more. 

4) Use the OCR data given in the previous assignment and employ the Naive Bayes Classifier (4 Marks)

	(194 - 204 line) in code.
	Accuracy For OCR Data : 71.80180180%
		


Observation and Result:

 Discretization: 92.66666667%
 without Discretization : 95.33333333%

 when we use discretization accuracy decreases compared to without discretizing.
 so, if we use the data  without Discretization one can get more accuracy.

RESULT:
Final Output:
Note : since i'm using random values we get random accuracy when we run the code at different time.
	so, run 5-6 times and we can verify it.
