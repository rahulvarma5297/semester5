ML Lab-7:


1. Divide the data into train-test split of 70:30.

	As discussed in class to take first 70% as train case and next 30% as test case.
	Train set -> 354
	Test Set -> 152
	Implemented in line (7-14)

2. Implement the Linear Regression Model to Predict the Median House Price value in Lakhs.

	12 Features are given and 1 last value is price(which is like a class).
	Let alpha value is  0.000011
	and used uniform distribution.


3. Implement the Gradient Descent with SSE to Optimize the model for up to 100 iteration and predict the test set.

	For 100 iterations: the θ is calculated:
	using θ = θ - α * partial derivative of(J(θ) / θ).
	and stored in data.
	Implemented in the line (30 - 33) in for loop.

	
4. Print the Coefficients of the Optimized model.

	Coefficients for those 12 features are stored in data and printed.
	Implemented in the line (36-39)

5. Print the SSE, MSE and R2 scores for the Train and Test Sets.

	Using the Formulas as explained in the lab.
	SSE, MSE, R2 is calcuated for Testing set and training set. 
	and printed
	Implemented in the line (56-65).



Result and Observation:

Note:
Since used the radom variable for uniform distribution by running code for 5-6 times i got this as teh best result.


The Coefficients of the Optimized model for each features are:
0.12302187
