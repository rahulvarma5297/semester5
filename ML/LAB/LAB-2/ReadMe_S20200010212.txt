ML Lab-2:

Submitted one file (I did for K-Fold Cross Validation and K-NNC):
	so by changing K value in the code at the line(136) we can get:
		K = 5 --> (5-Fold cross validation);
		In Line 139 I took for 10 K-NNC

Dividing the data into training data and the test data
I used a split percentage so that it will split(line 128) according to the percent we give.

1) Implement 5-Fold Cross Validation (5M): 
 	In code at line (136)
 	I initialized k value and we can change it to any K value for checking
 	So, if we change k value and run the program we can get the accuracy percantage
 	and the data is also divided into 120 and 30 as the  percentage (0.8) ie..(120/150).

2) Perform 5-Fold cross validation on KNN Classifier for IRIS Dataset (2M):
 	Since I did for a standard K by changing value of K and running the code can give us the accuracy and 
	percentage
	K = 5

3) Find out the best K value for the KNN Classifier using step-2. (2M):
 	I Run the 5-Fold cross validation for 10 value on KNN (1-10) and find the maximum value of accuracy for which value of K it is 	giving(many time i got K=3)
	This part is present in the line(159-166)

4) Report the validation accuracy and test accuracy of the classifier.  {Note, validation accuracy will have standard deviation, report that too}
 Since We are spitting randomly we get random accuracy(some time's same).

For one sample:
validation accuracy: (for 10 value of KNN algo)
93.33333333333334
90.0
100.0
95.0
95.0
96.66666666666666
100.0
93.33333333333333
95.0
93.33333333333334

Test accuracy of the classifier(combined accuracy) : 95.167%
Mean Accuracy: 95.167%
Variance : 8.583%
Standard Deviation : 2.930%
The Best Value of K is 3
