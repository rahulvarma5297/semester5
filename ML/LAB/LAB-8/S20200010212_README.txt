ML Lab-8:

I code all the main logic in regression_bias_variance_analysis function.

0. We assume that the correct relationship between the dependent and independent variables is t = 4+x1+3x2

	While generating the data for training and testing i used this function.
	Coded in the Line(25-33):
	dependent variable --> t.
	Independent Varaible --> x1 and x2.

	Used Uniform Distribution for generating x1 and x2 using np.random.uniform
	Function is present at the line (19-21).


1. Generate data where  x1 is uniformly distributed in (1,10); and x2 is also uniformly distributed in (2, 5).

	x1 is generated using random uniform function and taken range from 1 to 10.
	and generated random values.

	x2 is generated using random uniform function and taken range from 2 to 5.
	and generated random values.		

2. Add noise epsilon to the target where epsilon is drawn from the normal distribution with 0 mean and 0.25 variance.

	Added the Noice value while generating the independent varaible for both train and test data.
	Using np.random.normal with mean as 0 and variance as 0.25.

0,1,2 is implemented in the Line (7,33)
Just generating using numpy and following the given conditions.

3. Generate 10 different training sets each of size n. Training set size n should be varied from 100 to 1000 examples (you can say n is 100, 200, ..., 1000) and do the linear regression.

	10 Different Training sets are generated for each of size n as implemented in 6th Lab.
  	100,200 .. ,1000 are taken from 100 to 1000 with 100 gap.
	Logic at (59-60 in Code)
	and the Linear Regression Logic is Coded using formuals and some numpy functions.

4. Generate test set of size 100 do the bias variance analysis. Note that this test set is fixed.

	Test set is fixed, stored is varaiable using n = 100.
	In code (99 Line).




Result and Observation:

Note:
Since used the radom variable for uniform and normal distribution by running code for 5-6 times i got this as the best result.

Mean : [0.85618742, 0.86382069, 0.8533333, 0.85181875, 0.85338553, 0.85616618, 0.85300044, 0.85154459, 0.85178798, 0.85364668] .
Varaiance : [19.0392005, 18.37389358, 17.96853113, 17.56646356, 17.0952315, 16.55376785, 16.22373737, 15.85712294, 15.49254466, 15.06405056].


Bias is varying very slowly and with very less value by changing the value for n.
Varaince is decreasing as the value of n is increasing.
Due to adding the noise epsilon Varaince Value is high.
