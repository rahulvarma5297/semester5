Submitted one file by calculating the values for Bias and Variance

0. Do Bias Variance Analysis for the following.

Bias Varainace Analysis by calculating the values for Bias and Variance by using some classifier as per given in the pdf.


1. Use the classifier 1-Nearest neighbour classifier

Using KNN and taking Value K = 1, calculating ym and y*
Main prediction and Bayes Prediction.


2. Let there are two classes whose apriori probabilities are equal.

Two Classes are taken class - 1 and class - 2 and generated random values using numpy functions
Taken N = 10 and n  from 100 to 1000. For simplicity let taken values 100, 200, ...,1000.
Line(86-96) in code

3. Class 1 is drawn from the normal distribution with mean (0,0) and covariance matrix I (ie., the identity matrix of size 2x2).

Mean value taken as (0, 0) and covaraince matrix as [[1,0], [0,1]]
and generated values for class - 1
Line (40-52) generating values from mean and covariance

4. Class 2 is also drawn from the normal distribution with mean (0,2) and covariance matrix I (ie., the identity matrix of size 2x2).

Mean value taken as (0, 2) and covaraince matrix as [[1,0], [0,1]]
and generated values for class - 2
Line (40-52) generating values from mean and covariance

ym --> main Prediction.
y*--> Bayes Prediction.

 
Result and Observation:


Note: It takes nearly 2 minutes to run all data because we are taking a bit huge data.

Variance Values:
[0.36700000000000005, 0.2910000000000002, 0.33799999999999986, 0.352, 0.3320000000000002, 0.31800000000000006, 0.31400000000000006, 0.35500000000000015, 0.32600000000000007, 0.3230000000000001]

Bias Values:
[0.61, 0.69, 0.65, 0.63, 0.65, 0.67, 0.67, 0.64, 0.67, 0.68]

Observation:
Bias Values are more than the variance values for each n.
and the overall change for bias and varaince for each n is nearly same.


Result:
Bias Values are more than the variance values for each n.
Values are symmetric for the line y = 0.485 for each values
Values are symmetic for some y axis.
