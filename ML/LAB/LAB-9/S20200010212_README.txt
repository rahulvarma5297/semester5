ML Lab-9:


1. Create a 2D data of size 100, where 50 belongs to class -1 and 50 belongs to class +1.    Both these are drawn from Gaussians. Class -1 is drawn from Gaussian of mean (0,0) and covariance I (identity matrix of size 2x2). For class +1, the mean is (4,5) and the covariance is I. 

Train data is generated usihng np.random multi varaiate
stored in train_data and test_data.
coded this logic in line (82-96)


2. In a similar way create a test set of size 50. where 25 are for one class, and others are for the other.

In the same way created for test data also
coded this logic in line (97-108)

3. Build the linear classifier (i.e., the linear regression using the error SSE or MSE; that is, you will find w0, w1, and w2) using the gradient descent method.  {use appropriate learning rate}

gradient descent logic is  coded in line (21-32)

4. Show the results along with the test error.

Results are printed in the output terminal and graphs are plotted

5. Draw the classifier (that is, the line w0+w1x1+w2x2 = 0) in the 2D space along with training points. Points of different classes can be colored differently.

Finally the output also Plotted.



Result and Observation:

Train data is Plotted using graph
Final Output also plotted along with training points. Points of different classes.

Error on test set is:  0.0
Accuracy for the Training data is:  100.0
Accuracy for the Test data is:  100.0
